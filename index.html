      <p>HI! My name is Alex Perkins and I'm so glad to have you visiting my portfolio!</p>

      <p>I'm from a small town in southern Minnesota called Northfield, studied Biology at Iowa State, and moved out to Seattle 4 years ago with my beautiful wife, Waverly, and our two pet bunnies.</p>

      <p>I'm currently working at a startup, SkyKick, as a Technical Account Manager, helping Microsoft-partnering Managed Service Providers with their Office 365 Cloud migrations and Backup Services.</p>

      <p>My professional interests include full-stack development, IT, entrepreneurship, startups, account management, and custom API integration.</p>
